***Chapter 1:*** Functional Programming Basics
- 
- **Referentially transparent** = can move expression anywhere and it will have the same value (e.g. 3+5 is always 8)
- This makes programs **much** more modular or composable. 
- **Pure function** = one that when it takes _Referentially transparent_ parameters it is 
 also _Referentially Transparent_
 - Functional programming is about not having any side effects. Can do this via using pure functions everywhere 
 - Real programs typically have a **Pure Core** and a thin wrapper around program that isn't Pure/FP
 
 
***Chapter 2:*** Getting started (Scala syntax)
- 
- **Tail Recursive Functions:** 
- **Higher-Order Functions:** take functions as inputs and possibly also return functions as outputs
