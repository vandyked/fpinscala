***Chapter 1:*** Functional Programming Basics

- **Referentially transparent** = can move expression anywhere and 
it will have the same value (e.g. 3+5 is always 8)
 - **Pure function** = one that when it takes _Referentially transparent_ 
 parameters it is also _Referentially Transparent_
 - Functional programming is about not having any side effects. 
 Can do this via using pure functions everywhere (typically have a 
 **Pure Core** and a thin wrapper around program that isn't Pure/FP)
